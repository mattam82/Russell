automated theorem proving. Its aim is to combine the advantages of the
two paradigms. We focus on one particular application domain, which is
deduction for the purpose of software verification. Some of the
reported facts may not be valid in other domains. We report on the
integration concepts and on the experimental results with a prototype
implementation.}

  ABSTRACT = {The cut elimination theorem for predicate calculus states that every
proof may be replaced by one which does not involve use of the cut
rule. This theorem no longer holds when the system is extended with
Peano's axioms to give a formalisation for arithmetic. The problem of
generalisation results, since arbitrary formulae can be cut in. This
makes theorem-proving very difficult - one solution is to embed
arithmetic in a stronger system, where cut elimination holds. This
paper describes a system based on the omega rule, and shows that
certain statements are provable in this system which are not provable
in Peano arithmetic without cut. Moreover, an important application is
presented in the form of a new method of generalisation by means of
"guiding proofs" in the stronger system, which sometimes succeeds in
producing proofs in the original system when other methods fail. The
implementation of such a system is also described.}

  ABSTRACT = {This handbook provides ready access to all of the major concepts,
techniques, problems, and solutions in the emerging field of
pseudorandom pattern testing. Until now, the literature in this area
has been widely scattered, and published work, written by
professionals in several disciplines, has treated notation and
mathematics in ways that vary from source to source. This book opens
with a clear description of the shortcomings of conventional testing
as applied to complex digital circuits, revewing by comparison the
principles of design for testability of more advanced digital
technology. Offers in-depth discussions of test sequence generation
and response data compression, including pseudorandom sequence
generators; the mathematics of shift-register sequences and their
potential for built-in testing. Also details random and memory testing
and the problems of assessing the efficiency of such tests, and the
limitations and practical concerns of built-in testing.}

  ABSTRACT = {Authentication protocols are the basis of security in many
distributed systems, and it is therefore essential to ensure that
these protocols function correctly.  Unfortunately, their design has
been extremely error prone. Most of the protocols found in the
literature contain redundancies or security flaws. A simple logic has
allowed us to describe the beliefs of trustworthy parties involved in
authentication protocols and the evolution of these beliefs as a
consequence of communication. We have been able to explain a variety
of authentication protocols formally, to discover subtleties and
errors in them, and to suggest improvements. In this paper we present
the logic and then give the results of our analysis of four published
protocols, chosen either because of their practical importance or
because they serve to illustrate our method.}

general purpose tool for formulating and applying mathematics in a
familiar fashion.  The logic of IMPS is based on a version of simple
type theory with partial functions and subtypes.  Mathematical
specification and inference are performed relative to axiomatic
theories, which can be related to one another via inclusion and theory
interpretation.  IMPS provides relatively large primitive inference
steps to facilitate human control of the deductive process and human
comprehension of the resulting proofs.  An initial theory library
containing almost a thousand repeatable proofs covers significant
portions of logic, algebra and analysis, and provides some support for
modeling applications in computer science.}

  ABSTRACT = {"This paper defines the basic notion of a probabilistic Turing machine
(PTM). A PTM computes a partial function that assigns to each input
the output which occurs with a probability greater than half. It is
shown that a NDTM can be simulated by a PTM in the same space but with
a small error probability. Gill also considers the complexity classes
RP, PP, and BPP for polynomial-time PTMs (see Section 4.1). He shows
that $\mbox{P} \subseteq \mbox{RP} \subseteq \mbox{BPP} \subseteq
\mbox{PP} \subseteq \mbox{PSPACE}$ and that $\mbox{RP} \subseteq
\mbox{NP} \subseteq \mbox{PP}$."}

  ABSTRACT = {Set theory is the standard foundation for mathematics, but the
majority of general purpose mechanized proof assistants support
versions of type theory (higher order logic). Examples include Alf,
Automath, Coq, Ehdm, HOL, IMPS, Lambda, LEGO, Nuprl, PVS and
Veritas. For many applications type theory works well and provides,
for specification, the benefits of type-checking that are well-known
in programming. However, there are areas where types get in the way or
seem unmotivated. Furthermore, most people with a scientific or
engineering background already know set theory, whereas type theory
may appear inaccessable and so be an obstacle to the uptake of proof
assistants based on it. This paper describes some experiments (using
HOL) in combining set theory and type theory; the aim is to get the
best of both worlds in a single system. Three approaches have been
tried, all based on an axiomatically specified type V of ZF-like sets:
(i) HOL is used without any additions besides V; (ii) an embedding of
the HOL logic into V is provided; (iii) HOL axiomatic theories are
automatically translated into set-theoretic definitional
theories. These approaches are illustrated with two examples: the
construction of lists and a simple lemma in group theory.}

  ABSTRACT = {A generalisation of Milner's `LCF approach' is described. This allows
algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to be programmed
as derived proof rules in a calculus of representation judgements. The
derivation of representation judgements becomes an LCF-style proof by
defining an abstract type for judgements analogous to the LCF type of
theorems. The primitive inference rules for representation judgements
correspond to the operations provided by an efficient BDD package
coded in C (BuDDy). Proof can combine traditional inference with steps
inferring representation judgements. The resulting system provides a
platform to support a tight and principled integration of theorem
proving and model checking. The methods are illustrated by using them
to solve all instances of a generalised Missionaries and Cannibals
problem.}

  ABSTRACT = {The Accellera Property Specification Language (PSL) is designed for
the formal specification of hardware. The Reference Manual contains a
formal semantics, which we previously encoded in a machine readable
version of higher order logic. In this paper we describe how to
`execute' the formal semantics using proof scripts coded in the HOL
theorem prover's metalanguage ML. The goal is to see if it is feasible
to implement useful tools that work directly from the official
semantics by mechanised proof. Such tools will have a high assurance
of conforming to the standard. We have implemented two experimental
tools: an interpreter that evaluates whether a finite trace $w$, which
may be generated by a simulator, satisfies a PSL formula $f$ (i.e.~$w
\models f$), and a compiler that converts PSL formulas to checkers in
an intermediate format suitable for translation to HDL for inclusion
in simulation test-benches. Although our tools use logical deduction
and are thus slower than hand-crafted implementations, they may be
speedy enough for some applications. They can also provide a reference
for more efficient implementations.}

  ABSTRACT = {This book presents a systestematic treatment of deductive aspects and
structures of fuzzy logic understood as many valued logic sui
generis. Some important systems of real-valued propositional and
predicate calculus are defined and investigated. The aim is to show
that fuzzy logic as a logic of imprecise (vague) propositions does
have well-developed formal foundations and that most things usually
named `fuzzy inference' can be naturally understood as logical
deduction.

There are two main groups of intended readers. First, logicians: they
can see that fuzzy logic is indeed a branch of logic and may find
several very interesting open problems. Second, equally important,
researchers involved in fuzzy logic applications and soft
computing. As a matter of fact, most of these are not professional
logicians so that it can easily happen that an application, clever and
successful as it may be, is presented in a way which is logically not
entirely correct or may appear simple-minded. (Standard presentations
of the logical aspects of fuzzy controllers are the most typical
example.) This fact would not be very important if only the bon ton of
logicians were harmed; but it is the opinion of the author (who is a
mathematical logician) that a better understanding of the strictly
logical basis of fuzzy logic (in the usual broad sense) is very useful
for fuzzy logic appliers since if they know better what they are
doing, they may hope to do it better. In addition, a better mutual
understanding between (classical) logicians and researchers in fuzzy
logic, promises to lead to deeper cooperation and new results.

Audience: mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists, specialists
in artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, developers of
fuzzy logic.}

  JOURNAL = {Artificial Intelligence},

  ABSTRACT = {We consider two approaches to giving semantics to first-order logics
of probability. The first approach puts a probability on the domain,
and is appropriate for giving semantics to formulas involving
statistical information such as ``The probability that a randomly
chosen bird flies is greater than .9.'' The second approach puts a
probability on possible worlds, and is appropriate for giving
semantics to formulas describing degrees of belief, such as ``The
probability that Tweety (a particular bird) flies is greater than
.9.'' We show that the two approaches can be easily combined, allowing
us to reason in a straightforward way about statistical information
and degrees of belief. We then consider axiomatizing these logics. In
general, it can be shown that no complete axiomatization is
possible. We provide axiom systems that are sound and complete in
cases where a complete axiomatization is possible, showing that they
do allow us to capture a great deal of interesting reasoning about
probability.}

  ABSTRACT = {One way to ensure correctness of the inference performed by computer
theorem provers is to force all proofs to be done step by step in a
simple, more or less traditional, deductive system. Using techniques
pioneered in Edinburgh LCF, this can be made palatable. However, some
believe such an approach will never be efficient enough for large,
complex proofs. One alternative, commonly called reflection, is to
analyze proofs using a second layer of logic, a metalogic, and so
justify abbreviating or simplifying proofs, making the kinds of
shortcuts humans often do or appealing to specialized decision
algorithms. In this paper we contrast the fully-expansive LCF approach
with the use of reflection. We put forward arguments to suggest that
the inadequacy of the LCF approach has not been adequately
demonstrated, and neither has the practical utility of reflection
(notwithstanding its undoubted intellectual interest). The LCF system
with which we are most concerned is the HOL proof assistant.

The plan of the paper is as follows. We examine ways of providing user
extensibility for theorem provers, which naturally places the LCF and
reflective approaches in opposition. A detailed introduction to LCF is
provided, emphasizing ways in which it can be made efficient. Next, we
present a short introduction to metatheory and its usefulness, and,
starting from Gödel's proofs and Feferman's transfinite
progressions of theories, look at logical `reflection principles'. We
show how to introduce computational `reflection principles' which do
not extend the power of the logic, but may make deductions in it more
efficient, and speculate about their practical usefulness.
Applications or proposed applications of computational reflection in
theorem proving are surveyed, following which we draw some
conclusions. In an appendix, we attempt to clarify a couple of other
notions of `reflection' often encountered in the literature.

The paper questions the too-easy acceptance of reflection principles
as a practical necessity.  However I hope it also serves as an
adequate introduction to the concepts involved in reflection and a
survey of relevant work. To this end, a rather extensive bibliography
is provided.}

  ABSTRACT = {Many implementations of model elimination perform proof search by
iteratively increasing a bound on the total size of the proof. We
propose an optimized version of this search mode using a simple

compared, together with depth-bounded and best-first search, over the
entire TPTP problem library. The optimized size-bounded mode seems to
be the overall winner, but for each strategy there are problems on
which it performs best. Some attempt is made to analyze why. We
emphasize that our optimization, and other implementation techniques
like caching, are rather general: they are not dependent on the
details of model elimination, or even that the search is concerned
with theorem proving. As such, we believe that this study is a useful
complement to research on extending the model elimination calculus.}

automation provided. But another important consideration, which we
consider particularly significant, is the bias towards a `procedural'
or `declarative' proof style. We will explore this choice in depth,
and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of declarative and procedural
styles for proofs in pure mathematics and for verification
applications. We conclude with a brief summary of our own experiments
in trying to combine both approaches.}

  ABSTRACT = {There are many algorithms that make use of probabilistic choice, but
a lack of tools available to specify and verify their operation.  The
primary contribution of this paper is a lightweight modelling of such
algorithms in higher-order logic, together with some key properties
that enable verification. The theory is applied to a uniform random
number generator and some basic properties are established. As a
secondary contribution, all the theory developed has been mechanized
in the hol98 theorem-prover.}

  URL = {http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jeh1004/research/papers/thesis.html},
  ABSTRACT = {This thesis shows how probabilistic algorithms can be formally
verified using a mechanical theorem prover.

We begin with an extensive foundational development of probability,
creating a higher-order logic formalization of mathematical measure
theory. This allows the definition of the probability space we use to
model a random bit generator, which informally is a stream of
coin-flips, or technically an infinite sequence of IID Bernoulli(1/2)
random variables.

Probabilistic programs are modelled using the state-transformer monad
familiar from functional programming, where the random bit generator
is passed around in the computation. Functions remove random bits from
the generator to perform their calculation, and then pass back the
changed random bit generator with the result.

Our probability space modelling the random bit generator allows us to
give precise probabilistic specifications of such programs, and then
verify them in the theorem prover.

We also develop technical support designed to expedite verification:
probabilistic quantifiers; a compositional property subsuming
measurability and independence; a probabilistic while loop together
with a formal concept of termination with probability 1. We also
introduce a technique for reducing properties of a probabilistic while
loop to properties of programs that are guaranteed to terminate: these
can then be established using induction and standard methods of
program correctness.

We demonstrate the formal framework with some example probabilistic
programs: sampling algorithms for four probability distributions; some
optimal procedures for generating dice rolls from coin flips; the
symmetric simple random walk. In addition, we verify the Miller-Rabin
primality test, a well-known and commercially used probabilistic
algorithm. Our fundamental perspective allows us to define a version
with strong properties, which we can execute in the logic to prove
compositeness of numbers.}

while loop preserves useful program properties of measurability and

naturally interpreted as ``from every starting state, the while loop
will terminate with probability 1'', and we compare it to other
probabilistic termination conditions in the literature. For
illustration, we verify in HOL two example probabilistic algorithms
that necessarily rely on probabilistic termination: an algorithm to
sample the Bernoulli(p) distribution using coin-flips; and the
symmetric simple random walk.}

probability theory to specify and verify the Miller-Rabin

in algorithm textbooks implicitly accepts probabilistic termination,
but our own verified implementation satisfies the stronger property of
guaranteed termination.  Completing the proof of correctness requires
a significant body of group theory and computational number theory to
be formalized in the theorem prover.  Once verified, the primality
test can either be executed in the logic (using rewriting) and used to
prove the compositeness of numbers, or manually extracted to Standard
ML and used to find highly probable primes.}

procedures when used as tactics for proving subgoals in a higher-order

first-order proof tactics are useful, and then describe the core
integrating technology: an `LCF-style' logical kernel for clausal
first-order logic. This allows the choice of different logical
mappings between higher-order logic and first-order logic to be used
depending on the subgoal, and also enables several different
first-order proof procedures to cooperate on constructing the proof.
This work was carried out using the HOL4 theorem prover; we comment on
the ease of transferring the technology to other higher-order logic
theorem provers.}

and probabilistic nondeterminism, which makes it suitable for

We present a mechanization of the quantitative logic for pGCL using
the HOL4 theorem prover, including a proof that all pGCL commands
satisfy the new condition sublinearity, the quantitative
generalization of conjunctivity for standard GCL.

The mechanized theory also supports the creation of an automatic proof
tool which takes as input an annotated pGCL program and its partial
correctness specification, and derives from that a sufficient set of
verification conditions. This is employed to verify the partial
correctness of the probabilistic voting stage in Rabin's
mutual-exclusion algorithm.}

descent parsers is to model parsers as functions, and to define
higher-order functions (or combinators) that implement grammar

form an instance of a monad, an algebraic structure from mathematics
that has proved useful for addressing a number of computational
problems. The purpose of this report is to provide a step-by-step
tutorial on the monadic approach to building functional parsers, and
to explain some of the benefits that result from exploiting monads. No
prior knowledge of parser combinators or of monads is assumed. Indeed,
this report can also be viewed as a first introduction to the use of
monads in programming.}

Expressive type systems. These make specifications more consise and
accurate, but good automation is needed to solve proof obligations
that arise during type-checking.

Support for abstract theories. These have uses in supporting
mechanical proof developments, and in the domains of program
specification refinement and mathematics. Key issues are whether types
can be formed for classes of abstract theories and the need for
automatic inference of theory interpretations.

The tutorial assumed some familiarity with HOL-like theorem provers,
but did not assume familiarity with either PVS or Nuprl in
particular. The issue of Nuprl's constructivity was orthogonal to the
issues discussed and was therefore glossed over.}

  ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the use of formal development methods on an
industrial safety-critical application. The Z notation was used for
documenting the system specification and part of the design, and the
SPARK1 subset of Ada was used for coding. However, perhaps the most
distinctive nature of the project lies in the amount of proof that was
carried out: proofs were carried out both at the Z level-approximately
150 proofs in 500 pages-and at the SPARK code level-approximately
9,000 verification conditions generated and discharged. The project
was carried out under UK Interim Defence Standards 00-55 and 00-56,
which require the use of formal methods on safety-critical
applications. It is believed to be the first to be completed against
the rigorous demands of the 1991 version of these standards. The paper
includes comparisons of proof with the various types of testing
employed, in terms of their efficiency at finding faults. The most
striking result is that the Z proof appears to be substantially more
efficient at finding faults than the most efficient testing
phase. Given the importance of early fault detection, we believe this
helps to show the significant benefit and practicality of large-scale
proof on projects of this kind.}

  ABSTRACT = {Most specification languages have a type system. Type systems are
hard to get right, and getting them wrong can lead to
inconsistencies. Set theory can serve as the basis for a specification
languuage without types. This possibility, which has been widely
overlooked, offers many advantages. Untyped set theory is simple and
is more flexible than any simple typed formalism. Polymorphism,
overloading, and subtyping can make a type system more powerful, but
at the cost of increased complexity,and such refinements can never
attain the flexibility of having no types at all. Typed formalisms
have advantages too, stemming from the power of mechanical type
checking. While types serve little purpose in hand proofs, they do
help with mechanized proofs. In the absence of verification, type
checking can catch errors in specifications. It may be possible to
have the best of both worlds by adding typing annotations to an
untyped specification language. We consider only specification
languages, not programming languages.}

suitable for probabilistic programs.  Our construction is highly

precision of the analysis, basing ourselves on experimental results.}

programs, including those exhibiting demonic non-deterministic
choice. Probabilistic predicate transformers extend that facility to
programs containing probabilistic choice, so that one can in principle
determine not only whether a program is guaranteed to establish a
certain result, but also its probability of doing so.  We bring
together independent work of Claire Jones and Jifeng He, showing how
their constructions can be made to correspond; from that link between
a predicate-based and a relation-based view of probabilistic execution
we are able to propose "probabilistic healthiness conditions",
generalising those of Dijkstra for ordinary predicate transformers.
The associated calculus seems suitable for exploring further the
rigorous derivation of imperative probabilistic programs.}

calculus thus keeps the best properties of completion while giving up
only part of the goal-directedness.}

  ABSTRACT = {Many automatic theorem-provers rely on rewriting. Using theorems as
rewrite rules helps to simplify the subgoals that arise during a
proof. LCF is an interactive theorem-prover intended for reasoning
about computation. Its implementation of rewriting is presented in
detail. LCF provides a family of rewriting functions, and operators to
combine them. A succession of functions is described, from pattern
matching primitives to the rewriting tool that performs most
inferences in LCF proofs. The design is highly modular. Each function
performs a basic, specific task, such as recognizing a certain form of
tautology. Each operator implements one method of building a rewriting
function from sim- pler ones. These pieces can be put together in
numerous ways, yielding a variety of rewriting strategies. The
approach involves programming with higher-order functions. Rewriting
functions are data val- ues, produced by computation on other
rewriting functions. The code is in daily use at Cambridge, demon-
strating the practical use of functional programming.}

  ABSTRACT = {A theory of recursive definitions has been mechanized in Isabelle's
Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory. The objective is to support the
formalization of particular recursive definitions for use in
verification, semantics proofs and other computational
reasoning. Inductively defined sets are expressed as least
fixedpoints, applying the Knaster-Tarski Theorem over a suitable
set. Recursive functions are defined by well-founded recursion and its
derivatives, such as transfinite recursion. Recursive data structures
are expressed by applying the Knaster-Tarski Theorem to a set, such as
$V_{\omega}$, that is closed under Cartesian product and disjoint
sum. Worked examples include the transitive closure of a relation,
lists, variable-branching trees and mutually recursive trees and
forests. The Schr\"oder-Bernstein Theorem and the soundness of
propositional logic are proved in Isabelle sessions.}

  ABSTRACT = {The Omega test is an integer programming algorithm that can determine
whether a dependence exists between two array references, and if so,
under what conditions.  Conventional wisdom holds that integer
programming techniques are far too expensive to be used for dependence
analysis, except as a method of last resort for situations that cannot
be decided by simpler methods. We present evidence that suggests this
wisdom is wrong, and that the Omega test is competitive with
approximate algorithms used in practice and suitable for use in
production compilers. The Omega test is based on an extension of
Fourier-Motzkin variable elimination to integer programming, and has
worst-case exponential time complexity. However, we show that for many
situations in which other (polynomial) methods are accurate, the Omega
test has low order polynomial time complexity. The Omega test can be
used to simplify integer programming problems, rather than just
deciding them. This has many applications, including accurately and
efficiently computing dependence direction and distance vectors.}

  ABSTRACT = {Probability distributions are useful for expressing the meanings of
probabilistic languages, which support formal modeling of and
reasoning about uncertainty. Probability distributions form a monad,
and the monadic definition leads to a simple, natural semantics for a
stochastic lambda calculus, as well as simple, clean implementations
of common queries. But the monadic implementation of the expectation
query can be much less efficient than current best practices in
probabilistic modeling. We therefore present a language of measure
terms, which can not only denote discrete probability distributions
but can also support the best known modeling techniques. We give a
translation of stochastic lambda calculus into measure terms. Whether
one translates into the probability monad or into measure terms, the
results of the translations denote the same probability distribution.}

  ABSTRACT = {Formal hardware verification has recently attracted considerable
interest. The need for ``correct'' designs in safety-critical
applications, coupled with the major cost associated with products
delivered late, are two of the main factors behind this. In addition,
as the complexity of the designs increase, an ever smaller percentage
of the possible behaviors of the designs will be simulated. Hence, the
confidence in the designs obtained by simulation is rapidly
diminishing. This paper provides an introduction to the topic by
describing three of the main approaches to formal hardware
verification: theorem-proving, model checking and symbolic
simulation. We outline the underlying theory behind each approach, we
illustrate the approaches by applying them to simple examples and we
discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We conclude the paper by
describing current on-going work on combining the approaches to
achieve multi-level verification approaches.}

functional programming languages. In that setting, applications of
polytypism include elegant treatments of polymorphic equality,
prettyprinting, and the encoding and decoding of high-level datatypes
to and from low-level binary formats. In this paper, we discuss how
polytypism supports some aspects of theorem proving: automated
termination proofs of recursive functions, incorporation of the
results of metalanguage evaluation, and equivalence-preserving
translation to a low-level format suitable for propositional methods.
The approach is based on an interpretation of higher order logic types
as terms, and easily deals with mutual and nested recursive types.}

  NUMBER = {TR97-274},
  INSTITUTION = {Rice University},
  MONTH = APR,
  YEAR = 1997,
  ABSTRACT = {In the last 20 years modal logic has been applied to numerous areas
of computer science, including artificial intelligence, program
verification, hardware verification, database theory, and distributed
computing. There are two main computational problems associated with
modal logic. The first problem is checking if a given formula is true
in a given state of a given structure. This problem is known as the
model-checking problem. The second problem is checking if a given
formula is true in all states of all structures. This problem is known
as the validity problem. Both problems are decidable. The
model-checking problem can be solved in linear time, while the
validity problem is PSPACE-complete. This is rather surprising when
one considers the fact that modal logic, in spite of its apparent
propositional syntax, is essentially a first-order logic, since the
necessity and possibility modalities quantify over the set of possible
worlds, and model checking and validity for first-order logic are
computationally hard problems. Why, then, is modal logic so robustly
decidable? To answer this question, we have to take a close look at
modal logic as a fragment of first-order logic. A careful examination
reveals that propositional modal logic can in fact be viewed as a
fragment of 2-variable first-order logic. It turns out that this
fragment is computationally much more tractable than full first-order
logic, which provides some explanation for the tractability of modal
logic. Upon a deeper examination, however, we discover that this
explanation is not too satisfactory. The tractability of modal logic
is quite and cannot be explained by the relationship to two-variable
first-order logic. We argue that the robust decidability of modal
logic can be explained by the so-called tree-model property, and we
show how the tree-model property leads to automata-based decision
procedures.}

evaluation an automatic tool for generating very efficient conversions
from equality-stating theorems has been implemented. In the situation
where a Hol user would normally employ the built-in function
GEN\_REWRITE\_CONV, a function that directly produces a conversion of
the desired functionality, this article demonstrates how producing the
conversion in the form of a program text instead of as a closure can
lead to significant speed-ups. The Hol system uses a set of 31
simplifying equations on a very large number of intermediate terms
derived, e.g., during backwards proofs. For this set the conversion
generated by the two-step method is about twice as fast as the method
currently used. When installing the new conversion, tests show that
the overall running times of Hol proofs are reduced by about 10\%.
Apart from the speed-up this is completely invisible to the user. With
cooperation from the user further speed-up is possible.}

  ABSTRACT = {Formal proofs generated by mechanized theorem proving systems may
consist of a large number of inferences. As these theorem proving
systems are usually very complex, it is extremely difficult if not
impossible to formally verify them. This calls for an independent
means of ensuring the consistency of mechanically generated
proofs. This paper describes a method of recording HOL proofs in terms
of a sequence of applications of inference rules. The recorded proofs
can then be checked by an independent proof checker. Also described in
this paper is an efficient proof checker which is able to check a
practical proof consisting of thousands of inference steps.}

  ABSTRACT = {The Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) is defined in this
standard. Verilog HDL is a formal notation intended for use in all
phases of the creation of electronic systems. Because it is both
machine readable and human readable, it supports the development,
verification, synthesis, and testing of hardware designs; the
communication of hardware design data; and the maintenance,
modification, and procurement of hardware. The primary audiences for
this standard are the implementors of tools supporting the language
and advanced users of the language.}
