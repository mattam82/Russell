  ABSTRACT = {We present a coercive subtyping system for the calculus of
                  constructions. The proposed system $\lambda C_{\leq}^{co}$ is obtained
                  essentially by adding coercions and $\eta$-conversion to
                  $\lambda C_\leq$\cite{Chen97a}, which is a subtyping
                  extension to the calculus of constructions without
                  coercions. Following \cite{LMS95,LMS98}, the coercive
                  subtyping $c : A \leq B$ is understood as a special case
                  of typing in arrow type $c : A \to B$ such that the term
                  $c$ behaves like an identity function. We prove that,
                  with respect to this semantic interpretation, the
                  proposed coercive subtyping system is sound and complete,
                  and that this completeness leads to transitivity
                  elimination.  In addition, we establish the equivalence
                  between $\lambda C_{\leq}^{co}$ and $\lambda C_{\beta \eta}$, this fact implies that
                  $\lambda C_{\leq}^{co}$ has confluence, subject reduction and strong
                  normalization. We propose a formalization of coercion
                  inference problem and present a sound and complete
                  coercion inference algorithm.}
